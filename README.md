# Yuk's 2048 Game

Simple 2048 game playable in terminal, play by getting the Game2048 instance 

then invoke .start() (example in class Main)

# To be implemented:

1. Board customization : done
2. Gameover operation (right now, only inputting "q" can terminate the instance)
3. Undo operation (maybe inputting "undo"?)
4. Shuffle operation (maybe inputting "shuffle"?)
